# Sparse Word Vector

A word-vectoring package, using C++ bindings.
This is **alpha** versions and very likely to have bugs.

## what is it?

Given a JSON file of input text (sentiment analysis) it will
parse the text file using wordnet-3.0 and semantic relations,
then using statistics (x and y thresholds) it will substitute and compress
the sparse vectors.

## what is it for?

Anybody interested in NLP, semantic analysis and word vectoring, as well as classification.
